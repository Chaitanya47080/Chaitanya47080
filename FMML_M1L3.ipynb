        "The optimal values for angle constraint and shear constraint in data augmentation can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset. However, in general, it's common to use a range of values for angle constraint, such as between 10 to 30 degrees,and for shear constraint, a range of 10 to 20 degrees.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the example provided, the angle constraint is set to 45 degrees and the shear constraint is set to 16 degrees. This is a relatively conservative approach, as it allows for some flexibility in the augmentation process while still maintaining a reasonable level of similarity to the original images.\n",
        "\n",
        "As for the improvement in accuracy, the example shows that using data augmentation resulted in an increase in validation accuracy from 67.3% to 71.2%. This is a significant improvement, indicating that the augmentation process helped to reduce overfitting and improve the model's generalizability.\n",
